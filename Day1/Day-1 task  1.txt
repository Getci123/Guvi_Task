      Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

-> The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still used on the web.

-> In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 should have anticipated.

-> HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 is more rapid in how it prioritizes content during the loading Process.

-> HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the different resources behind it. HTTP/2 can use a single 
TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

-> In HTTP/1.1 each request had to wait for a response before the next request Could be sent. HTTP/2 uses multiplexing to allow multiple concurrent requests and responses over a single TCP Connection.

-> HTTP/1.1 relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow, so each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism. HTTP/2 multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection.

-> The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer.

-> This layer encapsulates messages — converted to their binary equivalent — while making sure that its HTTP semantics(method, details, header Information, etc) remain Untamed.
